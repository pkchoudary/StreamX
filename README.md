This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more info, see running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes for best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See deployment for details.

npm run eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you want full control over the build configuration (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), use this command.
All commands will still work but reference copied scripts.

You don’t have to eject to use Create React App, and most users never do.
